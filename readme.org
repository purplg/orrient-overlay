#+TITLE: Orrient Overlay

An overlay application for Guild Wars 2 similar to gw2taco or the BlishHUD pathing module.

This project is still under heavy development, is barely functional, and prone to breakage.

* Goals

- [x] Marker / Trails rendering :: The core is mostly implement, but is still being reworked a lot.
- [ ] Achievement API :: This will help with hiding (or showing) markers based on your account data and what you've completed.
- [ ] LUA plugin support :: Some marker packs come with LUA scripts to run things like timers for raid encounters and such.
- [ ] WASM plugin support :: Stretch goal. WASM is seemingly much more secure for a plugin infrastructure than LUA.
